JavaScript Quiz - Homework 4

This assignment is a multiple choice timed quiz that is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code focuses heavily on ID based variables as well as communicating with the user's local storage using functions, if/else and if/return statements. This quiz stores the high score of the user and lists them from highest to lowest. The assignment calls for time to be deducted for every incorrect answer, but I was unable to figure out that challenge.
